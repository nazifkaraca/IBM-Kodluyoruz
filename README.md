# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This Python program calculates the Euclidean distances between points in 2D space. It demonstrates the use of functions and loops to find the distance between all point pairs, and then determines the minimum distance among them.

## Features

- Define points in 2D space using a list of tuples.
- Calculate Euclidean distances between all point pairs using the formula:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
  \]
- Store distances in a list and find the minimum distance.

## Usage

1. Define your points as tuples in the `points` list.
2. Run the program to calculate and print all distances between the points.
3. The program will also print the minimum distance among the point pairs.

## Example

With the following points:
```python
points = [(1, 2), (4, 6), (5, 3), (7, 8), (2, 9)]
